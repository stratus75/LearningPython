# pythonNNexample
Annotations for the Sirajology Python NN Example. This code comes from a demo NN program from the YouTube video https://youtu.be/h3l4qz76JhQ by Siraj. The program creates a neural network that simulates the exclusive OR function with two inputs and one output.

PythonNNExampleFromSirajology.html is an HTML version of the code. This is useful for reading the code on a webpage. 

PythonNNExampleFromSirajology.ipynb is a Jupyter Notebook version. This is not necessary but useful for those who want to see annotations as they run the code. 

PythonNNExampleFromSirajology.py This is just Python script. Annotations appear in comments.
